## Description

70% of Americans regularly take prescription drugs, with more than half with at least two prescriptions. Taking the right drug at the correct time is difficult without a plan and daily reminders. With our cross-platform application Reminder Nurse, we help users stay on track with their dosages through notifications.

### Possible Future Features

We have a lot of development ideas, and we are open to newer ones. Below are some interesting features that could be very useful:

- Information about nearby pharmacies, their locations and timetables
